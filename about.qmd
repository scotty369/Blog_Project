About me:

Hi there! My name is Scott Townsend, and I'm a senior majoring in Data Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho. Currently, I'm working on my Senior Data Science Project, which has been an exciting and challenging journey.

Through this blog, I’ll be sharing updates on my project as I progress, along with any insights and challenges I face along the way. I'll also showcase other data science projects I’ve completed, as well as those I'm actively working on, ranging from statistical analyses to machine learning applications.
