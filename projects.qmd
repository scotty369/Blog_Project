## My Current Projects  

A collection of my personal projects showcasing my work in **data analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning**.  

### üîç Featured Projects  

- **[Streaming Services Data Analysis](https://github.com/scotty369/Streaming_Services)** *(January 2025 - Present)*  
  *Analyzed Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Amazon content libraries to uncover trends in movie durations, genres, and ratings.*  
  - Utilized **Polars** and **Pandas** for efficient data processing.  
  - Visualized insights with **Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly**, exploring genre popularity, rating distributions, and country-wise content production.  
  - Built **interactive dashboards** and statistical summaries to inform data-driven decisions.  

- **[Image Captioning Tool for Visually Impaired Users](https://github.com/scotty369/Senior-Data-Science-Project)** *(December 2024 - Present)*  
  *Developed a deep learning model to generate descriptive captions for images, aiding visually impaired individuals and automating social media captioning.*  
  - Implemented a **CNN (VGG16)** for image feature extraction and an **LSTM/Transformer** for caption generation.  
  - Visualized model attention areas using **heatmaps** and presented insights through data visualizations.  

- **[Crime Analysis](https://github.com/scotty369/Personal----Projects/blob/main/README.md)**  
  *Exploring crime trends through data analysis and visualization.*
